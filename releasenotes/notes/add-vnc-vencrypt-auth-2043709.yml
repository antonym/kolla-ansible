    Add support for secure VNC console connections using vencrypt authentication.
    This addresses security concerns where VNC connections were previously
    unencrypted and unauthenticated. The new feature introduces:
    
    * ``nova_vnc_auth_schemes`` option to configure VNC authentication methods
    * ``nova_vnc_enable_tls`` option to enable TLS encryption for VNC
    * Automatic certificate generation and distribution for VNC TLS
    * Integration with kolla-ansible's existing certificate management
    
    When ``nova_vnc_auth_schemes`` is set to "vencrypt" and 
    ``nova_vnc_enable_tls`` is enabled, VNC connections will use 
    certificate-based authentication between novncproxy and QEMU,
    preventing direct unauthorized access to VM consoles.
    
    See bug `2043709 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/kolla-ansible/+bug/2043709>`__
    for more details.

    VNC console connections can now be secured using certificate-based 
    authentication with the vencrypt scheme. This prevents unauthorized
    direct access to VM consoles by requiring proper certificate validation
    between the novncproxy service and QEMU instances. To enable this
    security feature, set ``nova_vnc_auth_schemes: "vencrypt"`` and 
    ``nova_vnc_enable_tls: "yes"`` in globals.yml.
